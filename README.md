# network-complexity
Code reproducing simulations in the paper "How Complex is a Complex Network? Insights from Linear Systems Theory".

MAIN_naive_k_fixed_n_100__9plots:
Run to reproduce the boxplots of the structural complexity index for Scale-free network (second figure generated by the script) and Small-world network (first figure generated by the script). 

MAIN_real_nets:
Run to reproduce the results of the structural complexity index for C. Elegans network, Northern European Power Grid and US Political Blogs.
